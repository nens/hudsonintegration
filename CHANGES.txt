Changelog of hudsonintegration
===================================================


0.1 (unreleased)
----------------

- Excluding generated django south migration files from pep8 and pyflakes.

- Showing and counting all pep8 errors, not just the first instance of an
  error. This new behaviour is prevented if you pass 'NOREPEAT' (without the
  quotes) as a command line option.

- Added documentation.

- Added jslint checker.

- Added basic run_test and create_reports scripts that basically mimic the
  bash scripts used in hudson.

- Initial library skeleton created by thaskel.  [Reinout]
